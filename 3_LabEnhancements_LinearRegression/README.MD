# Lab Enhancements: Linear Regression Analysis

In this project, it is an enhanced version of a lab exercise on Linear Regression analysis. Enhancements involve a holistic understanding of concepts of linear regression, advanced statistical measures and their applications. The notebook provides detailed explanations, sophisticated visualisation and analysis of a real world data set.

## Objectives
- To develop a deep understanding of Linear Regression fundamentals
- To explore advanced concepts like R-squared and Adjusted R-squared
- To master feature selection and handle multicollinearity
- To implement and understand regularization techniques
- To create effective visualizations for model analysis
- To apply Linear Regression to real-world datasets

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Concept Clarifications
- It helps to develop the deep fundamentals of linear regression
- In order to learn more about R-squared and Adjusted R-squared
- Feature selection and multicollinearity management are the two things that we want to master
- We will use regularization techniques and we will implement and understand them.
- This would help in creating effective visualizations for model analysis
- This is to apply Linear Regression to real world datasets

### 2. Advanced Visualizations
- Feature relationship visualization using plots
- Correlation matrices with heatmap representation
- shows results through Q-Q plots and distribution graphs along with residual analysis
- Model coefficient visualization
- Prediction confidence intervals
- Feature importance representation

### 3. Advanced Statistical Analysis
- Implementation of multiple regression models
- Comparison of different regularization techniques
- Analysis of model performance metrics
- Investigation of prediction intervals
- Assessment of model assumptions

### 4. Real-World Applications
- **California Housing Dataset**: Linear regression applied to predict housing prices.
- Comprehensive analysis of model performance on real data
- Practical interpretation of results and coefficients
