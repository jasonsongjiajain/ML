# LabEnhancements_PCA
## Filename: LabEnhancements_PCA.ipynb

## Notebook Structure
1. Necessary Original Codes (hidden) 
2. Data Visualization using PCA - Breast Cancer Dataset 
3. Data Visualization using PCA - CIFAR-10
4. Comparison with Other Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
5. Results Obervations and TO DO List for Deep Learning Training with CIFAR-10 Dataset 

## Enhancements
1. Breast Cancer Dataset 
    - added covariance matrix, explained variance vs number of components graph, feature loadings
2. CIFAR-10 Dataset
    - added explained variance vs number of components graph, feature loadings
3. Comparison with Other Dimensionality Reduction Techniques 
    - info of t-SNE, applied t-SNE on both datasets, visuals for t-SNE results on both datasets, observations, comparison between PCA and t-SNE, to do list for other dimensionality reduction methods
4. Results Obervations and TO DO List for Deep Learning Training with CIFAR-10 Dataset 
    - noted down observations of results (with and without PCA), added another task to to do list

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- NumPy, Pandas
- Sklearn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Usage
1. Load the dataset and preprocess it.
2. Apply PCA to reduce dimensions while retaining key variance.
3. Perform PCA and t-SNE.
4. Visualize and interpret PCA results. 

## Conclusion
This enhanced lab exercise serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and applying PCA, bridging the gap between theory and practice. It is a valuable tool for students in data science or statistical analysis, offering practical insights and hands-on experience.
